Update March 2014:
For example I'm using this Gem currently called 'Faker'
and once you do | bundle exec rake db:populate |
It just creates bunch of users depending on given sample data!

Few Cool Ones I use nowadays:


Found some new sick ones:
1- smartinez87/exception_notification
This can help alot in case the app crashes while it's in production.

2- gazay/gon
Passing Ruby to JS Varibales:


3- preston/railroady
"RailRoady  generates Rails 3/4 model (AcitveRecord, Mongoid, Datamapper) and  controller UML diagrams as cross-platform .svg files, as well as in the  DOT language."

4-https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman
"Brakeman is a static analysis tool which checks Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities."


UPDATE:
New Collection from here suggested by@Mohit Jain
Must have gems for development machine in ruby on rails

Just found this on reddit:
http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jrgwl/which_gems_do_you_have_in_your_global_gemset/

Mocha   is great. But when your library is all about manipulating the   filesystem, you really want to test the behavior and not the   implementation.
fakefs

Update 2013:

I changed my mind after using Squeel in production:
1- gem "squeel" : This is a gem for creating search, but in a very cool way. There is a rails cast about it as well:
#354 Squeel - RailsCasts
354-squeel

Pg_search Is better.

2- Act as taggable: acts-as-taggable-on
Pretty sexy gem for creating tags and skillsets.

3- better_errors : This is pretty cool at tracking errors, it basically brings the console to the page with the errors.
